Air Touch is a gesture based application which helps the users in minimizing their efforts to use various daily needed android applications.

We have used opencv and handwave libraries in collaboration with the project for sensing the gestures.

Initial required coding is completed for the project,like added ringtone modes,wifi detections,brightness,screenshots etc

We are planning to add more features for this application.
